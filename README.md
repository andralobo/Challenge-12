## Overview of UFO sightings Analysis
### Purpose


The purpose is to allow users to filter the UFO sighting results by date, city, state, country and shape. This will allow users to narrow down their search to provide more detailed analysis.

A data file was provided with a database that contains all the UFO sightings and is saved in a js file.

We used Javascript, html and Bootstrap to develop a webpage and funtionality to filter the data and display it.

Below is a sample of the filters that are available on the page:

## UFO Sightings Results

A user will access the website by clicking <a href="https://github.com/andralobo/Challenge-12/blob/main/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.  Once the page loads the user can enter in a date, city, state, country and/or shape and press enter and the results will display on the right.


## UFO Sightings Analysis Summary
I would recommend doing this analysis with more data.  The data for this analysis was only for 5 months and having data for an entire year we would be able to see which months perform better than others. Having information on the riders like their age and gender and the number of riders per ride we would be able to provide visualizations on those demographics.  We have the fare total, but we don't know how many miles there are per trip.  Being able to calculate the fare/mile could possibly show why the fares in Rural and Suburban cities are so high.

I wood recommend that PyBer focus on growing the Rural and Suburban cities to see how they can increase the number of rides.
