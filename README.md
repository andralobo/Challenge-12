## Overview of UFO sightings Analysis
### Purpose


The purpose is to allow users to filter the UFO sighting results by date, city, state, country and shape. This will allow users to narrow down their search to provide more detailed analysis.

A data file was provided with a database that contains all the UFO sightings and is saved in a js file.

We used Javascript, html and Bootstrap to develop a webpage and funtionality to filter the data and display it.





## UFO Sightings Results

A user will access the website and once the page loads the user can enter in a date, city, state, country and/or shape and press enter and the results will display on the right.

Below is a sample of the filters that are available on the page:

## UFO Sightings Summary

### Drawback
 -  One drawback of this webpage is that there is no reset button.  In order to clear the filters you need to refresh the screen

### Recommendations
 -  I would recommend adding a dropdown for each criteria so there is less room for error when the user is entering in their search
 -  I would also recommend adding a download button to allow the user to download the data from their search
